/**
 * Keeps colored light alive in client levels the player is not currently in.
 *
 * <p>Immersive Portals (and mods like it) keep several ClientLevels loaded at once and render a
 * remote dimension through portals. Only the current level is ticked through Forge's
 * LevelTickEvent (Immersive Portals ticks remote levels itself, without the Forge hooks), so the
 * engine's view area is never established there and every sample takes the vanilla-white
 * out-of-area fallback until the player has visited that dimension once. Rather than binding to
 * any Immersive Portals API, this tracks which chunks the client actually has loaded in each
 * level (chunks only exist in a non-current level when such a mod put them there) and mirrors
 * them into that level's engine as extra light regions, grouped into cells of
 * {@code CELL_SIZE * CELL_SIZE} chunks.
 *
 * <p>While a level IS the current one its coverage comes from the engine's view area, which also
 * filters out the chunks that can never propagate (see ColoredLightEngine#updateViewArea), so its
 * cells are withdrawn (chunk tracking continues, ready for the level to go remote again). The
 * withdrawal is a bookkeeping handover, not a purge: the engine keeps every section the view area
 * holds and only drops columns that neither the view area nor another cell covers.
 *
 * <p>Ordering matters for that handover. Immersive Portals can change the player's dimension from
 * its own hook at the tail of Minecraft#tick, i.e. after the level tick (which already ran for the
 * OLD level) but before ClientTickEvent END. Withdrawing the new level's cells from the client tick
 * at that point would run before the new level's view area exists, so nothing would be tracked and
 * every section of colored light would be wiped, to be re-propagated and re-meshed from scratch on
 * the following ticks. The withdrawal therefore runs from the level tick, right after the view area
 * update ({@link #onCurrentLevelTick}), where the ordering holds by construction; the client tick
 * only ever adds coverage to non-current levels.
 *
 * <p>Client thread only: chunk load/unload events, level unload, and both tick handlers run there.
